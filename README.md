# heart-attack-risk-prediction
Machine learning case study on predicting heart attack risk using demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data, with Random Forest achieving the best performance.
This case study focuses on predicting the risk of heart attacks using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes demographic, lifestyle, and clinical features such as age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, and lifestyle habits.

The main objective of this project is to:

Perform data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables).

Explore the data through statistical and visual analysis.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

Identify the most effective model for risk classification.

Among the tested models, Random Forest achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 56%, highlighting both the challenges of medical prediction tasks and the importance of high-quality datasets.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can be applied in the healthcare domain to gain insights and assist in early risk detection.
